## Description

Quick Root Finder - a C library designed for the single purpose of quickly finding all the roots of polynomials.

The library can compile on any major operating system, providing a standard, quick and reliable way accross operating systems to solve polynomial equtions.

The idea is to use multiple algorithms inside the library (based on the degree of the polynomial) and to expose just a helpfull API that helps solve the problem quickly and efficiently.

## Requirements && Build instructions:

In order to build the project the following are needed:
* C compiler (C99 standard) - the C standard is as old as possible in order to support many platforms
* cmake
* build system of choice (Make, Ninja, Visual Studio)

The project is intended to be built on as many platforms and operating system as possible. Embedded systems are also a concern for this target, and will be taken into account as much as possible.

## Use cases

Root finding is used in various fields:
* math
* physics
* chemistry
* biology
* engineering
* finance & economics
* computer graphics
* video & audio
* ML/ AI & computer vision

The list continues on and on. And by all means use this project for your own case and help expand the list.
